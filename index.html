        <p style="margin: 0;">Jeremy Rothman is internationally recognized as a visionary performing arts executive with 25 years of
            achievement in connecting performers, audiences, and communities through powerful artistic experiences. His
            innovative programming expands audiences, inspires philanthropy and ticket sales, and generates novel
            collaborations among institutions. He is a proven fundraiser, public spokesperson, strategic leader, and
            fiscal steward. </p><br>
        <p style="margin: 0;"><b>Genre-Defying Programming</b></p>
        <p style="margin: 0;">As the Chief Programming Officer of The Philadelphia Orchestra and Ensemble Arts, Jeremy unifies a
            portfolio of over 300 orchestral, theatrical, educational, and popular programming performances across three
            venues. Jeremy was an instrumental leader in the merger of The Philadelphia Orchestra and the Kimmel Center
            for the Performing Arts (now The Philadelphia Orchestra and Ensemble Arts), fully integrating artistic,
            education, and community programming into what is one of the largest performing arts series in the country,
            welcoming hundreds of thousands of visitors and 30,000 students annually. His programming explores
            compelling intersections between orchestral music, opera, dance, musical theater, the visual arts, and
            technology through creative collaborations with a wide array of genre-defying artists. </p>
        <br>
        <p style="margin: 0;"><b>Artistic Leaders of Today and Tomorrow</b></p>
        <p style="margin: 0;">Jeremy led the search process and launch of Yannick Nézet-Séguin’s appointment as only the eighth Music
            Director in The Philadelphia Orchestra’s history. He also navigated the roll-out of Marin Alsop as Music
            Director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, the first woman to lead a major American orchestra. In
            addition to these historic milestones, Jeremy has created programs that develop and mentor emerging talent –
            including training for young instrumentalists in public schools, composer workshops, and conductor
            fellowship programs.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="margin: 0;"><b>Expanding the Repertoire</b></p>
        <p style="margin: 0;">
            With a profound commitment to expanding and diversifying the symphonic repertoire, Jeremy has initiated or
            commissioned over 50 new orchestral works, the majority of which are composed by women or BIPOC artists. He
            has also secured grants to support the restoration and proliferation of works by historically overlooked composers
            like Florence Price and William Grant Still.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="margin: 0;"><b>Local and Global Impact</b></p>
        <p style="margin: 0;">Creating meaningful partnerships with cultural and social service organizations, Jeremy expands the reach of
            the performing arts into communities across the country and around the world by presenting artists in
            community centers, in hospitals, and in social service settings. Innovative collaborations with
            organizations – ranging from NASA to local libraries – demonstrate the versatile impact of the performing
            arts. And he has broadened access to orchestral music through digital media platforms, spearheading multiple
            GRAMMY award-winning recordings and crafting local and national radio broadcast series.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="margin: 0;"><b>Visionary Producer</b></p>
        <p style="margin: 0;">Jeremy has produced countless high-profile events, including The Philadelphia Orchestra’s essential role in
            Pope Francis’ internationally televised visit to Philadelphia. He has written for and collaborated with
            notable artists such as Sting, Steve Martin, Queen Latifah, Billie Jean King, John Williams, Whoopie
            Goldberg, and Hugh Jackman, among many others. And he has produced programming for more than a dozen
            international tours throughout Europe, Israel, and Asia, with a particular focus on cultural exchange in
            China. During the pandemic, his innovative approach to virtual programming bridged communities and small businesses
            struggling from the shutdowns.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="margin: 0;"><b>Proven Leader</b></p>
        <p style="margin: 0;">In his executive leadership role, Jeremy is an active fundraiser, securing six- and seven-figure foundation
            and individual support for operational and capital campaigns. He has a track record of rigorous fiscal
            management of eight-figure programming budgets and has been a leader in multiple organizational strategic
            plans. He appears regularly in television, radio, and print media as a spokesperson for the arts.</p>
        <br>
       
        <p style="margin: 0;">Jeremy completed the League of American Orchestras Orchestra Management Fellowship Program and earned a
            degree in Music Administration from the University of Rochester where he also studied trumpet performance at
            the Eastman School of Music.</p>
